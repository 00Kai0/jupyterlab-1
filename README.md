# JupyterLab + Binder

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/jupyterlab/master)

Demonstrating how to get JupyterLab working with Binder.

Currently, you may enable JupyterLab in Binder with the following steps:

1. Launch a Binder instance (e.g., by clicking the Binder badge below).
2. Replace `tree` at the end of your URL with `lab`.
3. That's it!

This repository installs several JupyterLab extensions via a `postBuild` script, allowing
you to use JupyterLab's extensions and widgets functionality.
